# 1 Prerequisites

*   Install at least Jekyll 4.3 if you do not have already. Please follow the instructions here for your operating system <https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/>.

*   $ gem install jekyll bundler

# 2 Setup

*   Clone the git repository.

        $ git clone < GIT_REPO_URL >

*   Navigate to the project folder

        $ cd  <path_to_project_folder>

*  To be able to track dependencies on this project, we are using Jekyll with Bundler.

* Also to avoid permissions issues, Bundler will install dependencies/gems within the project folder instead of the location used by gem install

* The usual way to use Jekyll is to install Jekyll to the system’s default gem installation directory and then run jekyll new. 

* Now we’re going to configure Bundler to install gems in the ./vendor/bundle/ project subdirectory. 

        $ bundle config set --local path 'vendor/bundle'
        $ bundle install

    Add these changes to .gitignore file, If it is not already edited.

        # Ignore metadata generated by Jekyll
        _site/
        .sass-cache/
        .jekyll-cache/
        .jekyll-metadata

        # Ignore folders generated by Bundler
        .bundle/
        vendor/  

# 3 Run Locally

*   Go to the project folder where you can find `Gemfile`.

        $ cd <path_to_project_folder> 

*   Run the server.

        $ bundle exec jekyll serve
